Practice your Catan opening placement strategy with this interactive board simulator. Generate random boards matching colonist.io's layout, then take turns placing settlements and roads for all four players in snake draft order (1-2-3-4-4-3-2-1). Visual hints show valid placement locations, and you can undo moves to try different strategies. Save board configurations to share or revisit specific setups.
